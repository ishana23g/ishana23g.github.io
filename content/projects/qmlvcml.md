# Quantum vs. Classical ML Package

A modular Python package for comparing Variational Quantum Classifiers with Classical Support Vector Machines.

## Overview

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning by implementing and comparing quantum and classical classification algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Modular Python package** with 20+ functions using strict OOP principles
- Implements Variational Quantum Classifiers using Qiskit
- Classical SVM implementation for baseline comparison
- **100% code coverage** across all class methods
- Comprehensive test suites with PyTest
- Detailed technical documentation for reproducibility

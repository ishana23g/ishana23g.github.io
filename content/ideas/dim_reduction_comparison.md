# Dimensionality Reduction Comparison

## Once You Have the Representation...

Compare dimensionality reduction techniques:
- UMAP
- PCA  
- t-SNE
- Other methods

## Research Areas

- How to select the right number of dimensions?
- Compare on different datasets: text vs video
- Parameter search strategies
- Non-linear methods (UMAP introduction)

## Experimental Setup

Test on various modalities and measure:
- Preservation of local structure
- Preservation of global structure
- Computational cost
- Interpretability of reduced dimensions

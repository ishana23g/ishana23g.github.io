# Music Embeddings & Compression

## Effect of Compression on Music Embeddings

Exploring how downloading vs streaming affects music embeddings — does compression change the semantic representation of audio?

## Personalized Music Discovery via Few-Shot Learning

Using music embeddings to build personalized recommendations:
- Label songs with custom tags (e.g., "karaoke songs", "favorites")
- Use few-shot learning to estimate other songs you'd like
- Create complex combinations of preferences

### Research Questions
- How do underground artists relate to popular artists in embedding space?
- Can we visualize millions of artists and trillions of songs meaningfully?
- What patterns emerge when comparing user taste profiles?
